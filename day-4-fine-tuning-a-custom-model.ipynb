Here's a breakdown to help you navigate:\n\n**The Bonneville Lineup (88-89)**\n\n* **Base Bonneville:** The standard model, offering a comfortable ride and basic features.\n* **LE (Luxury Edition):**  Added a bit more luxury with features like power windows, locks, and mirrors, along with plusher interior appointments. \n* **SE (Special Edition):**  Typically included more exterior chrome accents, upgraded interior trim, and possibly sportier wheel options.\n* **LSE (Luxury Special Edition):**  Combined the features of the LE and SE, offering a more luxurious and visually appealing package.\n* **SSE (Sport Sedan Edition):**  This is where things got more interesting! The SSE offered a higher-output 3.8L V6 engine (165 hp) and a firmer suspension, giving it a sportier driving experience. It also included sportier styling elements.\n* **SSEi (Sport Sedan Edition, Injected):**  This was the top-of-the-line model. It featured a fuel-injected version of the 3.8L V6, boosting horsepower to 170 and offering even better fuel economy. The SSEi also had a more sophisticated suspension, offering a refined and sporty ride.\n\n**Book Value and Market Demand**\n\nUnfortunately, providing exact book values is tricky. Websites like Kelley Blue Book (KBB) and Edmunds are great resources for this information, but they require you to input specific details about the vehicle (mileage, condition, etc.) for accurate estimates. \n\nHowever, here's a general idea of what you can expect:\n\n* **Condition:** The condition of the car will have the biggest impact on value. A well-maintained, low-mileage 89 Bonneville could fetch a higher price, while a high-mileage car with neglect could be significantly lower.\n* **Demand:** Bonneville's aren't exactly high-demand vehicles these days. They are considered classic, but their age and fuel efficiency can impact their appeal.\n* **Mid-Spring/Early Summer:** This is generally a decent time to buy a used car, as dealerships might be trying to clear inventory before the busy summer season.\n\n**Tips for Finding a Good Deal:**\n\n* **Be Patient:** Don't rush into buying. Take your time to research, compare prices, and inspect potential vehicles thoroughly.\n* **Shop Around:** Check both private sellers and dealerships. Private sellers may offer lower prices, but be prepared to handle all the legwork.\n* **Thorough Inspection:** Always get a pre-purchase inspection by a trusted mechanic to identify any potential problems.\n* **Negotiate:** Be prepared to negotiate the price. Don't be afraid to make an offer lower than the asking price. \n\nLet me know if you have any other questions about the 88-89 Bonneville models, or if you want help finding resources for book value estimates. \n\n","output_type":"stream"}],"execution_count":12},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"You can use the prompt engineering techniques you have learned this week to induce the model to perform the desired task.
