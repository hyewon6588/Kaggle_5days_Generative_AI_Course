You don't need to read the whitepaper to use this notebook, but the papers will give you some theoretical context and background to complement this interactive notebook.\n\n\n## Before you begin\n\nIn this notebook, you'll start exploring prompts and prompt parameters using the Python SDK and AI Studio. For some inspiration, you might enjoy exploring some apps that have been built using the Gemini family of models. Here are a few that we like, and we think you will too.\n\n* [TextFX](https://textfx.withgoogle.com/) is a suite of AI-powered tools for rappers, made in collaboration with Lupe Fiasco,\n* [SQL Talk](https://sql-talk-r5gdynozbq-uc.a.run.app/) shows how you can talk directly to a database using the Gemini API,\n* [NotebookLM](https://notebooklm.google/) uses Gemini models to build your own personal AI research assistant.\n\n\n## For help\n\n**Common issues are covered in the [FAQ and troubleshooting guide](https://www.kaggle.com/code/markishere/day-0-troubleshooting-and-faqs).**\n\n### A note on the Gemini API and Vertex AI\n\nIn the whitepapers, most of the example code uses the Enterprise [Vertex AI platform](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai). In contrast, this notebook, along with the others in this series, will use the [Gemini Developer API](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/) and [AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/).\n\nBoth APIs provide access to the Gemini family of models, and the code to interact with the models is very similar. Vertex provides a world-class platform for enterprises, governments and advanced users that need powerful features like data governance, ML ops and deep Google Cloud integration.\n\nAI Studio is free to use and only requires a compatible Google account to log in and get started. It is deeply integrated with the Gemini API, which comes with a generous [free tier](https://ai.google.dev/pricing) that you can use to run the code in these exercises.\n\nIf you are already set up with Google Cloud, you can check out the [Enterprise Gemini API](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/model-reference/inference) through Vertex AI, and run the samples directly from the supplied whitepapers.","metadata":{"id":"csNPnkuCobmG"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Get started with Kaggle notebooks\n\nIf this is your first time using a Kaggle notebook, welcome!

Yet, one day, a sudden gust of wind blew open the garden gate, and Bartholomew, with a flick of his tail and a gleam in his eye, took a leap of faith.\n\nHe padded through the overgrown grass, the scent of dew-kissed wildflowers filling his nostrils. The world was a vast, untamed tapestry of sights and sounds. A symphony of birdsong filled the air, and the sunlight danced through the canopy of leaves, painting the forest floor in patches of gold. Bartholomew, his whiskers twitching with excitement, followed a winding path, his paws brushing against moss-covered stones and fallen leaves.\n\nHe encountered a plump squirrel, its bushy tail twitching with annoyance at his presence. Bartholomew, ever the gentleman, politely offered a head-butt as a greeting, which the squirrel, after much huffing and puffing, accepted. He then encountered a mischievous family of rabbits, their long ears twitching with curiosity. He even shared a juicy worm with a grumpy toad, who, after a moment of hesitation, accepted the offering with a grateful croak.\n\nAs the sun began to set, painting the sky in hues of orange and purple, Bartholomew felt a pang of homesickness. He had explored so much, yet he yearned for the warmth of his cushion and the familiar purr of his human companion. With a newfound sense of purpose, he retraced his steps, his tail held high with the confidence of a seasoned explorer.\n\nHe found the gate ajar, just as he had left it. As he slipped back into the familiar comfort of his garden, Bartholomew realized that his adventure had been more than just a journey through the unknown. It was a journey of self-discovery, a confirmation of his own bravery and resilience. He looked up at the stars twinkling in the night sky, a silent promise to explore again, another day.

Think of it as a highly customizable Git status indicator for your command line.\n\n**What it does:**\n\nAt a high level, the script adds information to your shell prompt (the line that appears before you type a command) showing things like:\n\n* **Current Git branch:**  The name of the branch you're working on (e.g., `main`, `develop`).\n* **Changes:**  Indicators of uncommitted changes (added, modified, deleted files), conflicts, and stashed changes.\n* **Upstream status:**  Whether your local branch is ahead of, behind, or even with the remote branch it tracks.\n* **Virtual environment:** If you are working within a virtual environment (like venv, conda, or node), it shows the environment's name in the prompt.\n\n\n**Why you would use it:**\n\n* **Improved Git awareness:**  You get quick visual feedback about the status of your Git repository without having to explicitly run `git status`. This saves time and improves your workflow.\n* **Customization:** The script offers extensive customization options through environment variables (you can change colors, symbols, the information displayed, and more).  It even allows for creating custom themes.\n* **Cross-shell compatibility:** It aims to work with both bash and zsh shells.\n\n\nIn short, this script makes your shell smarter about Git, providing a concise summary of your repository's state directly in your prompt, saving you keystrokes and making you more productive.  You would use it by sourcing the script (e.g., `source /path/to/the/script.sh`) in your shell's configuration file (like `.bashrc` or `.zshrc`).\n"},"metadata":{}}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Learn more\n\nTo learn more about prompting in depth:\n\n* Check out the whitepaper issued with today's content,\n* Try out the apps listed at the top of this notebook ([TextFX](https://textfx.withgoogle.com/), [SQL Talk](https://sql-talk-r5gdynozbq-uc.a.run.app/) and [NotebookLM](https://notebooklm.google/)),\n* Read the [Introduction to Prompting](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/prompting-intro) from the Gemini API docs,\n* Explore the Gemini API's [prompt gallery](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/prompts) and try them out in AI Studio,\n* Check out the Gemini API cookbook for [inspirational examples](https://github.com/google-gemini/cookbook/blob/main/examples/) and [educational quickstarts](https://github.com/google-gemini/cookbook/blob/main/quickstarts/).\n\nAnd please share anything exciting you have tried in the Discord!","metadata":{"id":"2a8266d97ce5"}}]}
